              <strong>Fun and games with ones and zeros.</strong>
              <p>This course taught how to code through the production of interactive art. We covered concepts such as using code to draw simple shapes, responding to user input, understanding the physics required to produce simple simulations, and how to apply filters to video and images in real-time. I developed a strong understanding of the fundamentals of coding, the use of mathematics in code as well as the ability to apply them to generative art, data visualisation, and interactive animations by utilising a Javascript based language, P5.js.</p>

              <p>I loved this course so much, I went on to complete "The Nature of Code" by Dan Shiffman. This online course took the skills I had learnt an extra step further with developing visualisations of Newtonian physics systems, Autonomous Agents and Steering Behaviours with the P5.js library. For my final project I created a simulation using Genetic Algorithms that applies the four mechanisms found in genetics and evolutionary biology (Hardy Weinberg Principle, Genetic Drift, Selection and Mutation).

              <strong>Introduction to Robotics.</strong>
              <p>This course introduced me to the underlying architecture and principles of modern robotic hardware, software, and communication that build the foundation of modern Intelligent Systems. The course provided the knowledge of how components work together to define a system, and gave me an appreciation of the capabilities and limitations of computer and robotic systems. This knowledge assisted me in the design and development of using technologies to solve problems and provided a foundation for further study in the field of robotics.</p>
              <p>I applied this knowledge to develop intelligent robots and IoT devices. I designed and simulated a robot that creates a symbiosis with beneficial bacteria and fungi based on how the human nervous system connects with the stomach. The robot was designed to connect to the internet to order food and feed itself.</p>

              <strong>Applications to help those in need.</strong>
              <p>In this course, I became versed in how systems thinking can be used to tackle almost any problem imaginable, in order to identify the requirements (systems analysis) and find solutions to meet them (systems design). This course provided me with software development and acquisition competencies that are the underpinnings of ICT and Computer Science. I learnt how to plan the development of an information system, how to analyse and discover requirements, and then select the optimal design solution. Working in a team, we managed the system development processes by adopting an Agile methodology, currently a widely used project management approach applied in industry for software development.</p>
              <p>We designed the front and backend application for Meals on Wheels Australia using these tools and delivered the costings, estimated revenue projections and project timeframe for a mobile / web application that helps both the business and their clients in streamlining the processes required in providing food and services to those who experience disability and / or require aged care assistance.</p>

              <div class="container-fluid2">
                <p2><strong>Description</strong></p2>
                <p>Since my introduction to robotics I've been wanting to make an autonomous vehicle. There's something about perception that interests me greatly and I really want to understand it better. So I set myself the task of developing a small obstacle avoidance vehicle using an arduino microcontroller.</p>
                <p>This is what we're aiming for:</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/3d_design.jpg" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
                <p>The plan is to incorporate what I've learnt so far with basic sensors and challenge myself to create the code from beginning to end. Below I'll talk you through the process I underwent through the development and I've included all the components and code you need if you want to make one yourself.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/ping.jpg" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
                <p>The way in which our vehicle will operate is quite simple, it will drive forward and the ultrasonic sensor will keep measuring the distance from the vehicle to an obstacle. If it detects a collision, the vehicle will stop, look to it's left and right and change it's trajectory based on which side has the greater distance.  Let's start with planning.</p>

              <p2><strong>Design</strong></p2>
              <p>We'll use the Arduino Nano microcontroller as it encompasses the right amount of PWM pins required for the project in a small form factor.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/nanoSchematic.png" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
              <p>We'll use the TB6612FNG motor driver. Being fitted with MOSFETs, it will lead to a considerably lower energy requirement when compared to the more widely used L293D chip, allowing us to remain energy efficient.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/breadboardDesignFinal.png" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
              <p>This is the breadboard design implemented in the early stages of planning. Modifications to this design were made during the testing process and can be viewed further down in the documentation.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/flow2.jpg" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
              <p>I utilised Twine to configure a rough workflow of how the code will be written for our robot. Again, changes were made during testing to reduce complexity and are reflected below in the final code.</p>

              <p2><strong>Build</strong></p2>
              <p>The components will be tested individually to ensure they are in working order and to reduce troubleshooting in the later stages of the project when the level of complexity has grown. Once all hardware and programming has been completed, the system will be built as a whole and code will be integrated into a single file.</p>

                <p2>The early stages of the assembly process, integrating the hardware into a single vehicle.</p2>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/progress1.png" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
                <p2>Almost complete. I added some carbon vinyl to the body to give a better aesthetic.</p2>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/progress2.png" class="d-block w-75" alt=""></p>
                <p2>Testing out the serial monitor we can see that everything is reporting correctly.</p2>

              <p2><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p2>
              <p>Discovered the importance of "Divide and Conquer" - reducing into smaller parts and adding incrementally.</p>
              <p>Learnt how to overcome problems encountered by using components with low quality assurance. Hobby DC motors are quite fickle it seems.</p>
              <p>Gained hands on experience with creating and troubleshooting a robotic device without assistance.</p>
              <p>The project overall inspired me to take an elective in circuit board design and move towards designing my own PCB's for use.</p>
              <P>Inspired me to take the next step towards creating a Braitenberg Vehicle.</P>
